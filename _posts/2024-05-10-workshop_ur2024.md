#### Talk Summary

**Distributed Inference, Learning, and Control Between Fleets of Robots and the Cloud**

Today, we are starting to place high hopes and demands on fleets of networked robots. Ideally, they should be cheap, compute/memory/power efficient, and highly resilient and autonomous in the physical world. However, this is at odds with the way machine learning, and especially generative AI is trending today. We are building larger and larger models that are fairly accurate, but compute, power, and data hungry. In this talk, I’ll describe our work on augmenting robotic inference and learning with cloud resources using algorithms that gracefully trade-off accuracy with systems costs of inference, storage, bandwidth, labeling, and compute costs. I will highlight our papers in top robotics and ML venues like RSS, CoRL, ICML, and MLSys.

#### Short Bio

Sandeep Chinchali is an assistant professor in UT Austin’s ECE department.  He completed his PhD in computer science at Stanford and undergrad at Caltech, where he researched at NASA JPL. Previously, he was the first principal data scientist at Uhana, a Stanford startup working on data-driven optimization of cellular networks, now acquired by VMWare. Sandeep’s research on cloud robotics, edge computing, and 5G was recognized with the Outstanding Paper Award at MLSys 2022 and was a finalist for Best Systems Paper at Robotics: Science and Systems 2019. His group is funded by companies such as Lockheed Martin, Honda, Viavi, Cisco, and Intel and actively collaborates with local Austin startups.

#### Talk Summary

**Cloud robotics and on-device A.I. in the generative A.I. era**

As generative A.I. technology advances to the level of commercialization, on-device A.I. technology is getting high attentions from the industry. It is inherently based on low-power enabling technology and requires no network connection and, hence, no subscription fee for any A.I. service. At the same time, however, its limitations are clear. For example, it won't be able to generate the correct information when it was asked a live sport game score. We believe that the ultimate future will be cloud-native, multi-modal, and deeply networked. On the road to that future, two technologies may be complementary in a sense that cloud robotics technology help the development of future on-device applications and low power technology developed for on-device A.I. can be used to save power in the cloud servers. LG electronics is also working on both. In this talk, I will introduce what LG electronics is doing under this subject.
